# Silent-Neighbor
Silent Neighbor is a 2-player cooperative horror experience developed in Unity. The Project aims to showcase networked gameplay mechanics, proximity-based sanity systems, and synchronized mission objectives.

# Project Summary
The game follows the story of two brothers, Mark and Leo, who investigate the long-abandoned "Old Miller Estate." Driven by a foul stench and rhythmic knocking echoing from the basement at 3:00 AM, the brothers must confront the source of the rot and discover the secret hidden behind the manor's walls.

# Narrative Premise
Mark and Leo have lived next to the estate their entire lives. Lately, the atmosphere has shifted—a thick, metallic scent of decay has begun to permeate the air. Armed with only cheap flashlights, the brothers enter the estate to investigate the source of the nightly disturbances, only to find themselves trapped in a situation far more dangerous than they anticipated.
